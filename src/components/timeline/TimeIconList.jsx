    title: "Software Engineer Intern",
    description: "During this internship, I was able to develop a deeper understanding of Python, GUIs, and Web Apps. This was done through completing assigned projects throughout the internship and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My first task was to develop a PDF encryptor GUI with Tkinter, a desktop app that allows PDF files to be encrypted locally with passwords of the Userâ€™s choice. \nI then developed a security inspector GUI with Tkinter for Webmail and Owncloud accounts. Where given 2 textfiles, 1 for usernames and 1 for passwords, the user can check the security of each username, hence ensuring that their accounts are secure. \nFor my final task, I started working on a web app in DingYalk that scrapes a DingTalk user's calendar data. This web app is run inside DingTalk and is written in AXML, ACSS, and Javascript. The goal of the web app is to allow the transfer of data from the retrieved calendar data onto the user's Owncloud calendar."
